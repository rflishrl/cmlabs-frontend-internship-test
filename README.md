## ðŸ’¡ Troubleshooting

- **npm: command not found**: Ensure that Node.js is installed and properly set up. You can verify this by running `node -v` and `npm -v`.
- **Port 3000 already in use**: If the server doesn't start, it may be because port 3000 is in use. Try stopping any process using the port or run the server on a different port by specifying it in your `.env` file.
